Lecture 3 - Threads and Processes
- Recall: Illusion of Multiple Processors
	- threads: virtual cores
	- multiple threads: multiplex hardware in time
	- executed on processor when it is resident in the processor's registers
	- maintains its own PC, stack pointer, etc.
- Recall: (Virtual) Address Space
	- set of accessible addresses + state associated with them
	- virtual address space: processors view of the memory
		- independent of physical storage

- Recall: Process
	- protected environment with 1+ threads and a protected address space
	- instance of a running program
- Recall: Dual Mode Operation:
	- processes execute in user mode, kernels execute in kernel mode
	- carefully controlled transitions between user mode and kernel mode (system calls, interrupts, exceptions)
- Thread definitions:
	- single unique execution context
	- abstraction of execution sequence that represents a separately schedulable task
	- mechanism of concurrency (overlapping execution) but can also run in parallel (simultaneous execution)
- Motivation for Threads:
	- OS's need to handle multiple things at once (mouse, i/o, MTAO)
		- network servers, parallel programs, user interface (mouse, mic, camera)
	- threads can represent one thing or task
- multiprocessing vs multiprogramming:
	- multiprocessing = multiple cores/cpus on the same task
	- multiprogramming = multiple jobs/processes (not necessarily simultaneously)
	- multithreading = multiple threads/processes
	- two threads running concurrently: scheduler can run two threads in any order/any interleaving
- concurrency vs parallelism:
	- concurrency is MTAO, parallelism is specifically simultaneous and implies concurrency
- threads are in one of the following three states/queues:
	- running
	- ready (eligible)
	- blocked (maybe due to some i/o operation it is waiting for)
